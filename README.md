# LeetCode Solutions: A Dual-Language Approach

Python is actually pretty fast, and Java is even faster. This repository documents my journey of solving LeetCode problems in both languages, leveraging the strengths of each.

*   **Python** for its conciseness and speed of development.
*   **Java** for its performance and to keep its syntax fresh in my mind.

Solutions are organized by problem category (following a the **NeetCode 150** list) and then by problem name. I seperate the problems using the Neetcode roadmap. Each problem has two files: `[problem-name].py` and `[problem-name].java`.

## Why Two Languages?

| Aspect                | Python Solution                                  | Java Solution                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development Speed** | Fast to write and test. Concise, readable code.  | More verbose, but explicit typing can help with design. |
| **Runtime**           | Generally fast enough for most cases.            | Often faster due to its compiled nature.                |
| **Primary Goal**      | Quickly implement and validate logic.            | Practice strict OOP, type safety, and efficient code.   |

## Prerequisites

To run the solutions locally, you'll need the languages and their tools installed:

*   **Python 3:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **Java JDK 11+:** [https://adoptium.net/](https://adoptium.net/)

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the problem's directory.
2.  Run the Python file:
    ```bash
    python3 problem-name.py
    ```
3.  Compile and run the Java file:
    ```bash
    javac problem-name.java
    java problem-name
    ```

*(Note: Most solutions are designed to be run and tested directly on the LeetCode platform, which handles inputs/outputs. These local files contain the core solution logic.)*

## Progress Tracking

I'm systematically working through problem lists to strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge.

| Category                 | Total Problems | Completed |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | --------- |
| Arrays & Hashing         | 9              | `9` ‚úÖ     |
| Two Pointers             | 5              | `3` üü°     |
| Stack                    | 7              | `0` üî¥     |
| ...                      | ...            | ...       |

**Status Key:** ‚úÖ Complete | üü° In Progress | üî¥ Not Started

## FAQ

**Q: Why not use C++?**  
A: I'm focusing on languages I use most for application development. Python and Java cover a great spectrum of speed and expressiveness.

**Q: Can I use your code?**  
A: Absolutely! Feel free to use it for learning purposes. However, I encourage you to try solving the problems yourself first for the maximum learning benefit.

**Q: How do you decide which language to use first?**  
A: I typically solve a problem in Python first to quickly grasp the algorithm, then I implement it in Java to ensure type safety and think about performance optimizations.
